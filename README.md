# Agni Operating System

Agni OS is a minimal operating system built from scratch using Assembly and C.  
It uses a custom legacy bootloader, switches to 32-bit protected mode, and loads a simple kernel that displays a terminal window.  
The OS supports a few basic commands such as `help`, `clear`, and `about`.

This project was created to explore low-level programming, bootloaders, and operating system fundamentals.
